    <p data-summary>At it's most basic you can generate a form by simply @HelperFunctions.Wiki("form-model#datasourcetype-datasourcetype", "specifying") a data source type, connection alias and the name of the table. Default functionality includes a search box that will perform a wildcard search against all string based columns in the dataset, navigation where more than one record is returned and the ability to update, insert and delete records.</p>
